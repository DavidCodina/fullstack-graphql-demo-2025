# MERN GraphQL Demo

This project is split into two main folders: client and server. Each should run independently and should be opened in their own Terminal window.

**Auth:** This project implements a custom JWT authentication system that includes role-based access control for admins. Additionally, it uses a `BroadcastChannel` instance on the client to manage cross-tab comms during the logout process.

**Comments Disclaimer:** Many files in this project have verbose comments. If this were an actual production app, I would not include so many comments. While they are helpful, they also obscure the natural readability of the code.

**Forms Disclaimer:** The forms are a little verbose because I'm not currently using React Hook Form or Zod. I decided to just do it all from scratch for this project. In a production app I would likely use third-party libraries.
